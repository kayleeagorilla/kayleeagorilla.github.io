In the midst of the ‘Back to School’ chaos, learning a whole new coding language, JavaScript is the cherry on top of it all. So far everything is going well, aside from the sleepless nights and new white hairs I have acquired. I do enjoy coding in JavaScript, it is a much easier coding experience compared to Java, C, and C++. The way I see JavaScript is a glorified, more refined, Java 2.0. 

## I am a Software Engineering Athlete
I did feel like a newbie since it’s been a whole year since I took an actual coding class. That is why I feel like I’m learning how to swim again. During the first few days of learning how to code in JavaScript, I felt like I was drowning and overwhelmed with the new learning style and syntax. But after consistently practicing and dedicating a chunk of my time every day towards JavaScript, I have been able to slowly become a Software Engineering Athlete. 

At first, hearing about Athletic Software Engineering I wasn’t too sure what it actually meant. After seeing how much I have progressed and learning a whole new coding language over the course of a few days, I have been subconsciously doing what Athletic Software Engineering actually was. Obviously, I have not mastered it but I can say that practice and putting in the time and effort absolutely pays off.

## A Practice WOD a Day, Keeps The Doctor Away
I hate being under pressure but I do admit that it isn’t too bad. The practice WODS do help and give me the opportunity to put my coding knowledge to the test. After practice WODS, whether I was able to finish under the time limit or not, I am able to see my weak points and areas where I have to put my focus. 

After going through the FreeCodeCamp, it was like reading and all the information goes through one ear and out the other. The way I see coding is like learning how to drive. You can study for your permit and practice driving in the parking lot all day but nothing will beat the real thing, driving with other cars and going on the freeway. Of course, when you first get your license, you won't be the best driver in town. But after consistency and refining your skills, you will be able to become more comfortable and proficient in the things that you struggled with before, both in coding and driving. 

Overall, my experience with JavaScript has been a rollercoaster but I am still buckled in and here for the ride.

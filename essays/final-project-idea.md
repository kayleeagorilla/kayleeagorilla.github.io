## Overview

Whenever University of Hawaii users face a tech-related problem, they visit the UH Information Technology Service (ITS) AskUs page. Here, users can enter their questions and be presented with a list of results. The problem with this search method is that the website returns results only containing keywords that are found in your question. This makes finding an answer a hassle since users are expected to go through possibly over a hundred posts. Users are also expected to be precise with their questions, leaving no room for any errors. For example, when faced with a wifi-related problem, users who spell wifi like ‘wi-fi’ will be presented with no results.

The solution that our team strives to achieve is to make a user-friendly chatbot that uses A.I. to help users find an answer to their questions quickly and with no effort needed. Users will be able to ask their questions through a conversation with the chatbot. We also aim to revamp the ITS AskUs page by giving it a modern and updated look.

## Mockup page ideas

* Home - Users will be presented with a small description of the website and can ask their questions in the chatbox
* Forum - Users can post their questions/experiences as a post if they aren’t satisfied with the answer the chatbot has given. Allows community interaction.
* Contact ITS - Contains contact information to the UH Information Technology Service (ITS).
* Admin Login - Admins can access the ITS files, which the ChatBot uses to create a correct answer for the user.
* Report Page - Users can make a report that will be sent to the Admins. Admins can also view user reports about the ChatBot, to make sure that the problem does not occur again.

## Use case ideas
Users will be able to quickly ask their question on the home page in the chatbox that will be located in the bottom right corner. Once their question has been sent to the chatbot, the chatbot will then take the top result and return a summary of the post. The user can either continue the conversation by asking more questions. But after the user has gotten their answer, they can give ratings from 1-5 on how satisfied they are with their answer and their experience.

If a user is unsatisfied with their answer and wasn’t able to find what they were looking for, they can enter their name, contact information, and question and a post will be made in a forum where users and admins can answer.

Admins will be able to log in and control which questions the chatbot has access to. Adding or removing results from the database.

## Beyond the basics
Instead of having a simple search bar, we will implement a chatbot that uses A.I. to make the user experience easier.

A forum section will be added to encourage user interaction and get the community involved. Users may share their experiences or help in a forum post. Admins can then approve a reoccurring problem and add it to the database that the A.I. can access and recognize as an answer to similar questions that future users may ask.

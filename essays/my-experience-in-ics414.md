It has been exactly a year since I took ICS 314. That was where I started my journey in software engineering and developed a few of my first web applications. Now, I'm in ICS 414 and building upon my existing software engineering skills and continuing to develop more projects. Throughout this past semester, I have learned a lot from this class. I got to experience what it would be like to develop a web application for a customer and working with a bigger team made of people that I didn't know before.

# "It wasn't always smooth sailing"

To be honest, it wasn't easy and it was a bumpy journey. I remember the first week of the semester and we were randomly assigned to our teams. Each team was made up of 8 total members, but our team only had 7 because 1 of our members dropped the class. I believe that from the start, some of the others teams had an upper hand since they had more members, but we didn't let that discourage us from what we could achieve.

We all didn't know each other so the first week was mainly us breaking the ice, setting everything up for our GitHub, and figuring out which roles and responsibilities we should assign each other. We all had different strengths and weaknesses but we were able to help each other out and learn from each other. I ended up focusing on working on the frontend UI since that was what I was most comfortable with. Even though I didn't work on the backend, I was still able to see how my teammates developed the backend and how it all came together in the end.

It was a great experience because I got to see how a real-world project is developed and how different people work together to achieve a common goal.

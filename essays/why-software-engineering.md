Ever since I was a kid, I enjoyed working and being around computers and different types of technology. I fell in love with Apple because of how minimalistic, simple, and how sleek both the devices and brand were. I remember when I used to watch TV with my parents and an Apple commercial would come on to advertise the new iPhone, iPod Touch, or Macbook. I would beg my parents to get me an iPod Touch because I knew asking for a phone or laptop as a kid was too much. Even back in elementary, I remember how excited I would get when our teacher would bring us to the computer lab, and the room was filled with Mac computers. 

## How I Almost Went A Different Route
That is part of the reason why I chose to go into Computer Science and became interested in Software Engineering. At first, I hesitated because the major demographic was men. Discouraged, I looked at different career paths like becoming a Nurse or Lawyer. I always made it my goal to get a well-paying job so that I could give back to my parents for all that they have sacrified and the hours of work they have put in to provide for me. Looking at other careers didnâ€™t satisfy me as much as Computer Science did. I wanted to be able to get a job that made me happy and excited when I woke up. After talking with my peers, I later found out how many of these companies are actually looking for diversity, and that was when I decided to commit to my dream. Some may call it, healing my inner child, and to be honest, I currently feel like a kid in a candy store. 

## What Do I Want To Improve On?
Some skills and experiences that I plan on developing are my problem-solving skills and expanding my array of coding languages. So far the only coding languages I know are Java, C, C++, and I just started learning Javascript. I want to get to know the basics of Python, HTML, or any other programming languages that catch my interest down the road. 

As for developing my problem-solving skills, the practice WODS and actual WODS we do in class are helping me improve that aspect of my skills. Especially real-life problems and doing it under a time limit. I believe these skills will definitely be beneficial to me later in my college career and even in the work field. I also hope to make many connections with professors, mentors, and classmates so that I can make a plan when looking for internships and other opportunities.

Although I prepared every day leading up to the first WOD, I was left shaking from all the adrenaline after I finished in Rx time. In those days leading up, I did every practice WOD that was given to us over and over. The practice WODs were very beneficial since they gave me a sense of what to expect on the actual WOD. For example, many of the practice WODs consisted of functions, for-loops, if-statements, arrays, and objects. Even one of the practice WODs had a for-of-loop that I was unfamiliar with until I completed the problem. 

## Was the experience valuable? What could you do to improve your performance for the next WOD?

The experience was valuable to me. It took all the practice WODs and compiled them into one WOD. The actual WOD was like a test for our skills and knowledge. It helped me solidify the materials and gain more problem-solving skills for future projects and even the real world. Seeing my hard work and practicing everyday payoff, gave me a better understanding of what it is like to be an Athletic Software Engineer.

For me to improve my performance for the next WOD, I want to go over more syntax for Javascript in case something new pops up that wasn’t on the practice WODs. What I’ve started to do recently is go back to FreeCodeCamp and do the exercises that I’m not familiar with. Like creating classes, constructors, and methods.

##  How did I implement the function compared to what was discussed after the WOD?

I implemented my WOD differently from what was discussed after the WOD. The way I implemented my WOD is that I created a function that contained a for-loop that lets i to start at 1 and increments until i was less than or equal to 100. In the for-loop, I used if-statements and else-if statements to print either BertErnie if a number is a multiple of 4 and 6, Bert if the number is only a multiple of 4, Ernie if the number is only a multiple of 6, and the number is just printed if it is not a multiple of either 4 or 6. 

Although my code was correct, it was different from what was shown to us after the WOD. The code that was shown used a function that had if-statements and else-if statements but without using a for-loop, then it would use recursion to call itself until it has reached 100. 

## Is it important to discuss the WOD afterward?

I believe that it is always important to discuss the WOD after it has been completed because we are all able to discuss different ways we implemented the function and other parts of the code. It will also be helpful to those who weren’t able to finish before the DNF time because they get a better understanding and see what they need to improve on for the next WOD. I forgot that we could use recursion and I even found out that there is a way to implement only 1 if-statement and no loops. It gives me a better insight into what is capable when using Javascript.
